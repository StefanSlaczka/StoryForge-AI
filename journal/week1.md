# Week 1 Journal

**Goal for this week:**

Get a solid foundation on how chatbots work and understand key concepts of AI that will power my interactive storytelling app.

---

### What I already know

* Basic chatbot mechanics: prompt matching, simple if-else responses

### Things I will be doing this week

1. **Research and learn about Finite State Machines (FSM)**
   * Understand what FSMs are and how they can model conversation flow
   * Find simple examples of FSMs controlling chatbots or game dialogue
2. **Study Branching Logic for interactive stories**
   * Learn how stories can branch based on user choices
   * Explore examples of choose-your-own-adventure style narrative trees
3. **Explore basic NLP concepts**
   * Learn about keyword detection and pattern matching in text
   * Try simple implementations in JavaScript or Node.js (e.g., regex or string matching)
4. **Plan simple chatbot architecture**
   * Sketch how my chatbot engine might work with FSM + keyword detection
   * List components needed for the backend and frontend to handle conversations
5. **Set up initial project environment**
   * Initialize a Node.js + Express backend project
   * Create a basic Svelte frontend project for chat UI
