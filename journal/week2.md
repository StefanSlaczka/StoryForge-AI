# Week 2 Journal

**Goal for this week:**

Finish the character creation feature of my interactive storytelling app, store characters in a database, and ensure basic data management works smoothly.

### What I already know (from Week 1)

* **Basic chatbot mechanics:** prompt matching, simple if-else responses
* **Finite State Machines (FSM):** how they can model conversation flow and control branching dialogues in games or chatbots
* **Branching Logic for interactive stories:** how stories can change direction based on user choices, using narrative trees
* **Basic NLP concepts:** keyword detection, pattern matching (regex and string matching in JavaScript/Node.js)
* **Basic chatbot architecture planning:** combining FSM + keyword detection, identifying components for backend and frontend
* **Project setup:** Node.js + Express backend, basic Svelte frontend chat UI
