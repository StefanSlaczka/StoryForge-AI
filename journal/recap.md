Four days in, I have:

* Learned about finite state machines (FSMs) by creating and experimenting with them.
* Gained a better understanding of how conversation flow works.
* Explored using multi-word inputs to communicate within conversations.
* Started developing a script to create characters and environments.
* Build a UI for the application

Overall, I think this is great progress for just four days in.
