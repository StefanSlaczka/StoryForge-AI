# 📘 Smart Tutor: Independent Learning App for Underserved Students

## 🧠 Project Goal
Design and build a full-stack tutoring system that helps underserved students (middle or high school) learn math and history by guiding them to solve problems on their own. The focus is on increasing **independent learning ability**, not just giving answers.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Svelte
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express)
- **Database**: SQLite

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Create a working prototype of a tutoring system that supports step-by-step learning.
2. Focus on **math problem solving** and **historical analysis** as initial modules.
3. Incorporate a logic system for adaptive hints, mistake feedback, and step tracking.
4. Provide a student progress tracker with data stored in SQLite.
5. Evaluate system effectiveness through real or simulated user testing.
6. Produce documentation and a research paper to demonstrate system design, purpose, and results.
